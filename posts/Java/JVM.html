Java虚拟机。JVM 本质上是一个运行在计算机上的程序，他的职责是运行Java字节码文件。</p><p>Java源代码执行流程如下：</p><figure><img src="https://jackchen-note.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Java/jvm/1710821125829-280.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>分为三个步骤：</p><p>1、编写Java源代码文件。</p><p>2、使用Java编译器（javac命令）将源代码编译成Java字节码文件。</p><p>3、使用Java虚拟机加载并运行Java字节码文件，此时会启动一个新的进程。</p><h2 id="_1-2-jvm的功能" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-2-jvm的功能"><span>1.2 JVM的功能</span></a></h2><ul><li>1 - 解释和运行</li><li>2 - 内存管理</li><li>3 - 即时编译</li></ul><h3 id="_1-2-1-解释和运行" tabindex="-1"><a

解释和运行</span></a></h3><p>对字节码文件中的指令，实时的解释成机器码，让计算机执行。</p><p>字节码文件中包含了字节码指令，计算器无法直接执行，Java虚拟机会将字节码文件中的字节码指令实时地解释成机器码，机器码是计算机可以运行的指令。</p><figure><img

内存管理</span></a></h3><ul><li>自动为对象、方法等分配内存</li><li>自动的垃圾回收机制，回收不再使用的对象</li></ul><p>Java虚拟机会帮助程序员为对象分配内存，同时将不用的对象使用垃圾回收器回收掉，这是对比C和C++这些语言的一个优势。在C/C++语言中，对象的回收需要程序员手动去编写代码完成，如果遗漏了这段删除对象的代码，这个对象就会永远占用内存空间，不会再回收。所以JVM的这个功能降低了程序员编写代码的难度。</p><h3 id="_1-2-3-即时编译" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-2-3-即时编译"><span>1.2.3 即时编译</span></a></h3><p>对热点代码进行优化，提升执行效率。即时编译可以说是提升Java程序性能最核心的手段。</p><h4 id="java性能低的主要原因和跨平台特性" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#java性能低的主要原因和跨平台特性"><span>Java性能低的主要原因和跨平台特性</span></a></h4><p>Java语言如果不做任何的优化，性能其实是不如C和C++语言的。主要原因是：</p><p>在程序运行过程中，Java虚拟机需要将字节码指令实时地解释成计算机能识别的机器码，这个过程在运行时可能会反复地执行，所以效率较低。</p><figure><img src="https://jackchen-note.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Java/jvm/1710821125815-2.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>C和C++语言在执行过程中，只需要将源代码编译成可执行文件，就包含了计算机能识别的机器码，无需在运行过程中再实时地解释，所以性能较高。</p><figure><img src="https://jackchen-note.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Java/jvm/1710821125815-3.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Java为什么要选择一条执行效率比较低的方式呢？主要是为了实现跨平台的特性。Java的字节码指令，如果希望在不同平台（操作系统+硬件架构），比如在windows或者linux上运行。可以使用同一份字节码指令，交给windows和linux上的Java虚拟机进行解释，这样就可以获得不同平台上的机器码了。这样就实现了Write Once，Run Anywhere 编写一次，到处运行 的目标。</p><figure><img src="https://jackchen-note.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Java/jvm/1710821125815-4.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>但是C/C++语言，如果要让程序在不同平台上运行，就需要将一份源代码在不同平台上分别进行编译，相对来说比较麻烦。</p><p>再回到即时编译，在JDK1.1的版本中就推出了即时编译去优化对应的性能。</p><figure><img src="https://jackchen-note.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Java/jvm/1710821125815-5.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>虚拟机在运行过程中如果发现某一个方法甚至是循环是热点代码（被非常高频调用），即时编译器会优化这段代码并将优化后的机器码保存在内存中，如果第二次再去执行这段代码。Java虚拟机会将机器码从内存中取出来直接进行调用。这样节省了一次解释的步骤，同时执行的是优化后的代码，效率较高。</p><p>Java通过即时编译器获得了接近C/C++语言的性能，在某些特定的场景下甚至可以实现超越。</p><h2

Minsky 发布了复制算法。</p><p>本质上后续所有的垃圾回收算法，都是在上述两种算法的基础上优化而来。</p><figure><img src="https://jackchen-note.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Java/jvm/1710821125826-224.png" alt="" tabindex="0"

href="#垃圾回收算法的评价标准"><span>垃圾回收算法的评价标准</span></a></h3><p>Java垃圾回收过程会通过单独的GC线程来完成，但是不管使用哪一种GC算法，都会有部分阶段需要停止所有的用户线程。这个过程被称之为Stop The World简称STW，如果STW时间过长则会影响用户的使用。</p><p>如下图，用户代码执行和垃圾回收执行让用户线程停止执行（STW）是交替执行的。</p><figure><img src="https://jackchen-note.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Java/jvm/1710821125826-225.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>所以判断GC算法是否优秀，可以从三个方面来考虑：</p><p>1.吞吐量</p><p>吞吐量指的是 CPU 用于执行用户代码的时间与 CPU 总执行时间的比值，即吞吐量 = 执行用户代码时间 /（执行用户代码时间 + GC时间）。吞吐量数值越高，垃圾回收的效率就越高。</p><figure><img src="https://jackchen-note.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Java/jvm/1710821125826-226.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>2.最大暂停时间</p><p>最大暂停时间指的是所有在垃圾回收过程中的STW时间最大值。比如如下的图中，黄色部分的STW就是最大暂停时间，显而易见上面的图比下面的图拥有更少的最大暂停时间。最大暂停时间越短，用户使用系统时受到的影响就越短。</p><figure><img

href="#_4-5-垃圾回收器"><span>4.5 垃圾回收器</span></a></h2><p>为什么分代GC算法要把堆分成年轻代和老年代？首先我们要知道堆内存中对象的特性：</p><ul><li>系统中的大部分对象，都是创建出来之后很快就不再使用可以被回收，比如用户获取订单数据，订单数据返回给用户之后就可以释放了。</li><li>老年代中会存放长期存活的对象，比如Spring的大部分bean对象，在程序启动之后就不会被回收了。</li><li>在虚拟机的默认设置中，新生代大小要远小于老年代的大小。</li></ul><p>分代GC算法将堆分成年轻代和老年代主要原因有：</p><p>1、可以通过调整年轻代和老年代的比例来适应不同类型的应用程序，提高内存的利用率和性能。</p><p>2、新生代和老年代使用不同的垃圾回收算法，新生代一般选择复制算法，老年代可以选择标记-清除和标记-整理算法，由程序员来选择灵活度较高。</p><p>3、分代的设计中允许只回收新生代（minor gc），如果能满足对象分配的要求就不需要对整个堆进行回收(full gc),STW时间就会减少。</p><p>垃圾回收器是垃圾回收算法的具体实现。</p><p>由于垃圾回收器分为年轻代和老年代，除了G1之外其他垃圾回收器必须成对组合进行使用。</p><p>具体的关系图如下：</p><figure><img

解决GC问题的手段</span></a></h3><p>解决GC问题的手段中，前三种是比较推荐的手段，第四种仅在前三种无法解决时选用：</p><ul><li>优化基础JVM参数，基础JVM参数的设置不当，会导致频繁FULLGC的产生</li><li>减少对象产生，大多数场景下的FULLGC是由于对象产生速度过快导致的，减少对象产生可以有效的缓解FULLGC的发生</li><li>更换垃圾回收器，选择适合当前业务场景的垃圾回收器，减少延迟、提高吞吐量</li><li>优化垃圾回收器参数，优化垃圾回收器的参数，能在一定程度上提升GC效率</li></ul><h4 id="优化基础jvm参数" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#优化基础jvm参数"><span>优化基础JVM参数</span></a></h4><p><strong>参数1 ： -Xmx 和 –Xms</strong></p><p>-Xmx参数设置的是最大堆内存，但是由于程序是运行在服务器或者容器上，计算可用内存时，要将元空间、操作系统、其它软件占用的内存排除掉。</p><p>案例： 服务器内存4G，操作系统+元空间最大值+其它软件占用1.5G，-Xmx可以设置为2g。</p><p>最合理的设置方式应该是根据最大并发量估算服务器的配置，然后再根据服务器配置计算最大堆内存的值。</p><figure><img src="https://jackchen-note.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Java/jvm/1710822688593-34.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>参数1 ： -Xmx 和 –Xms</p><p>-Xms用来设置初始堆大小，建议将-Xms设置的和-Xmx一样大，有以下几点好处：</p><ul><li>运行时性能更好，堆的扩容是需要向操作系统申请内存的，这样会导致程序性能短期下降。</li><li>可用性问题，如果在扩容时其他程序正在使用大量内存，很容易因为操作系统内存不足分配失败。</li><li>启动速度更快，Oracle官方文档的原话：如果初始堆太小，Java 应用程序启动会变得很慢，因为 JVM 被迫频繁执行垃圾收集，直到堆增长到更合理的大小。为了获得最佳启动性能，请将初始堆大小设置为与最大堆大小相同。</li></ul><p><strong>参数2 ： -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize 和 –XX:MetaspaceSize</strong></p><p>-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=值 参数指的是最大元空间大小，默认值比较大，如果出现元空间内存泄漏会让操作系统可用内存不可控，建议根据测试情况设置最大值，一般设置为256m。</p><p>-XX:MetaspaceSize=值 参数指的是到达这个值之后会触发FULLGC（网上很多文章的初始元空间大小是错误的），后续什么时候再触发JVM会自行计算。如果设置为和MaxMetaspaceSize一样大，就不会FULLGC，但是对象也无法回收。</p><figure><img

-Xss虚拟机栈大小</strong></p><p>如果我们不指定栈的大小，JVM 将创建一个具有默认大小的栈。大小取决于操作系统和计算机的体系结构。</p><p>比如Linux x86 64位 ： 1MB，如果不需要用到这么大的栈内存，完全可以将此值调小节省内存空间，合理值为256k – 1m之间。</p><p>使用：-Xss256k</p><p><strong>参数4 ： 不建议手动设置的参数</strong></p><p>由于JVM底层设计极为复杂，一个参数的调整也许让某个接口得益，但同样有可能影响其他更多接口。</p><p>-Xmn 年轻代的大小，默认值为整个堆的1/3，可以根据峰值流量计算最大的年轻代大小，尽量让对象只存放在年轻代，不进入老年代。但是实际的场景中，接口的响应时间、创建对象的大小、程序内部还会有一些定时任务等不确定因素都会导致这个值的大小并不能仅凭计算得出，如果设置该值要进行大量的测试。G1垃圾回收器尽量不要设置该值，G1会动态调整年轻代的大小。</p><figure><img

伊甸园区和幸存者区的大小比例，默认值为8。</p><p>‐XX:MaxTenuringThreshold 最大晋升阈值，年龄大于此值之后，会进入老年代。另外JVM有动态年龄判断机制：将年龄从小到大的对象占据的空间加起来，如果大于survivor区域的50%，然后把等于或大于该年龄的对象，放入到老年代。</p><p>比如下图中，年龄1+年龄2+年龄3 = 55m已经超过了S区的50%，所以会将年龄3及以上的对象全部放入老年代。</p><figure><img src="https://jackchen-note.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Java/jvm/1710822688593-38.png" alt="" tabindex="0"

id="_1-3-应用场景" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-3-应用场景"><span>1.3 应用场景</span></a></h2><p>GraalVM的AOT模式虽然在启动速度、内存和CPU开销上非常有优势，但是使用这种技术会带来几个问题：</p><p>1、跨平台问题，在不同平台下运行需要编译多次。编译平台的依赖库等环境要与运行平台保持一致。</p><p>2、使用框架之后，编译本地镜像的时间比较长，同时也需要消耗大量的CPU和内存。</p><p>3、AOT 编译器在编译时，需要知道运行时所有可访问的所有类。但是Java中有一些技术可以在运行时创建类，例如反射、动态代理等。这些技术在很多框架比如Spring中大量使用，所以框架需要对AOT编译器进行适配解决类似的问题。</p><p>解决方案：</p><p>1、使用公有云的Docker等容器化平台进行在线编译，确保编译环境和运行环境是一致的，同时解决了编译资源问题。</p><p>2、使用SpringBoot3等整合了GraalVM

Agent技术，这种技术可以让运行中的Java程序执行Agent中编写代码。</p><p>Arthas使用了Agent中的动态加载模式，可以选择让某个特定的Java进程加载Agent并执行其中的监控代码。监控方面主要使用的就是JMX提供的一些监控指标，同时使用字节码增强技术，对某些类和某些方法进行增强，从而监控方法的执行耗时、参数等内容。</p><p><strong>APM系统是如何获取到Java程序运行中的性能数据的？</strong></p><p>回答：</p><p>APM系统比如Skywalking主要使用了Java

虚拟机会从上至下遍历异常表中的所有条目。当触发异常的字节码的索引值在某个异常表条目的监控范围内，Java 虚拟机会判断所抛出的异常和该条目想要捕获的异常是否匹配。</p><p>1、如果匹配，跳转到“跳转PC”对应的字节码位置。</p><p>2、如果遍历完都不能匹配，说明异常无法在当前方法执行时被捕获，此方法栈帧直接弹出，在上一层的栈帧中进行异常捕获的查询。</p><figure><img

catch代码块中,保证在try和catch执行之后一定会执行finally中的代码。</p><p>如下，在<code>i=1</code>和<code>i=2</code>两段字节码指令之后，都加入了finally下的字节码指令。</p><figure><img

href="#方法区的实现-1"><span>方法区的实现</span></a></h3><p>方法区是《Java虚拟机规范》中设计的虚拟概念，每款Java虚拟机在实现上都各不相同。Hotspot设计如下：</p><ul><li>JDK7及之前的版本将方法区存放在堆区域中的永久代空间，堆的大小由虚拟机参数来控制。</li><li>JDK8及之后的版本将方法区存放在元空间中，元空间位于操作系统维护的直接内存中，默认情况下只要不超过操作系统承受的上限，可以一直分配。也可以手动设置最大大小。</li></ul><figure><img

loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>使用元空间替换永久代的原因：</p><p>1、提高内存上限：元空间使用的是操作系统内存，而不是JVM内存。如果不设置上限，只要不超过操作系统内存上限，就可以持续分配。而永久代在堆中，可使用的内存上限是有限的。所以使用元空间可以有效减少OOM情况的出现。</p><p>2、优化垃圾回收的策略：永久代在堆上，垃圾回收机制一般使用老年代的垃圾回收方式，不够灵活。使用元空间之后单独设计了一套适合方法区的垃圾回收机制。</p><h3

loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>字符串常量池从方法区移动到堆的原因：</p><p>1、垃圾回收优化：字符串常量池的回收逻辑和对象的回收逻辑类似，内存不足的情况下，如果字符串常量池中的常量不被使用就可以被回收；方法区中的类的元信息回收逻辑更复杂一些。移动到堆之后，就可以利用对象的垃圾回收器，对字符串常量池进行回收。</p><p>2、让方法区大小更可控：一般在项目中，类的元信息不会占用特别大的空间，所以会给方法区设置一个比较小的上限。如果字符串常量池在方法区中，会让方法区的空间大小变得不可控。</p><p>3、intern方法的优化：JDK6版本中intern () 方法会把第一次遇到的字符串实例复制到永久代的字符串常量池中。JDK7及之后版本中由于字符串常量池在堆上，就可以进行优化：字符串保存在堆上，把字符串的引用放入字符串常量池，减少了复制的操作。</p><h3 id="总结-7" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor"

G1（JDK8之前不建议，较大堆并且关注暂停时间）</p><p>JDK9之后:</p><p>G1（默认）</p><p>从JDK9之后，由于G1日趋成熟，JDK默认的垃圾回收器已经修改为G1，所以强烈建议在生产环境上使用G1。</p><p>如果对低延迟有较高的要求，可以使用Shenandoah或者ZGC。</p><h2 id="如何解决内存泄漏问题" tabindex="-1"><a
